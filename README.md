# DataVisualization_Tableau_Awareness-About-Covid-Vaccination

In today's worlds, with so large volume of data being obtained through data analysis, we need a way to show that data so we can understand it. Data visualization helps us point out what data means by putting it in a visual context, such as maps or graphs. This allows the human mind to interpret the data more naturally, making it easier to spot trends, patterns, and outliers in large data sets. By using tableau software here we implement the project for COVID-19 data and vaccination data to aware people importance of vaccination and how vaccination will help to minimize the risk of COVID, and it will be helpful to reduce the death count. Data visualization may help by presenting information in the most effective way possible. Because it takes raw data, models it, and delivers it so that conclusions can be formed, data visualization is a crucial component in the business intelligence process.
